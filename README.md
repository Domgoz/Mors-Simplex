# Mors-Simplex ![image info](./icon.png)
A simple web extension counting your days.

## Idea ðŸ’€
I originally used [lifeisshort.fyi](lifeisshort.fyi), but i had a very spesific taste on how i wanted it to look. I actually wanted to SEE the seconds go by. >o<

## Install
Firefox
For Chromium based.

## Todo:
- [ ] Add some minor customizability options (background, daily quotes, day stats)
